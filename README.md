# Modified Maui Container for ALCF Job Reservation Impact Analysis

This is a fork of the IT4Innovations repository for running the Maui Simulator in a docker container. The original README with instructions is included below. In addition, before building the container, change the line `RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash userx -u 1001` such that the last number matches the uid of your user account on the host machine, resolving a volume mounting permissions issue.


# Maui Simulation Setup for IT4Innovations
This repository contains the setup of the Maui Scheduler to simulate the job scheduling of IT4Innovations' large-scale PBS based Salomon cluster. It has been used in our paper **Job Simulation for large-scale PBS based Clusters with the Maui Scheduler** (see section [Paper and Citation](#paper-and-citation) below) and is made available to enable other PBS based computing centers to run simulations. The following files are available:
- `Dockerfile`: To create a Docker image with the Maui Scheduler environment. It includes PBS for satisfying the dependencies only, which does not need to run as a service.
- `maui.diff`: Modifications applied to the Maui Scheduler for our simulation runs.
- `maui.cfg`: Configuration file for the Maui Scheduler.
- `Resource.Trace1`: Trace file for Salomon cluster resources.
- `Workload.Trace_example`: Workload trace file (example only).
- `control_example.sh`: Control script for the simulation (example only).

> **Note**: No real workloads are made available due to privacy reasons.

# Quick Start Guide

1. Build the Docker image:  
Change the user name (replace `userx`) and paths in `maui.cfg` and `Dockerfile` to reflect your environment. Then, build the Docker image:  
`$ docker build -t maui_simulator .`

2. Start the Docker container:  
`$ docker run --rm -it --hostname mauisim -v $PWD:/home/userx/workdir maui_simulator`  
Change the path `/home/userx/workdir` according to the previous changes.

3. Start simulation:  
Within the Docker container, start the Maui Scheduler's simulator:  
`/usr/local/maui/sbin/maui --host=mauisim &`  
The default port Maui receives commands is `40559`. A different one can be specified by adding the option `--port=XYZ`.
Then, execute the control script `control_example.sh` as shown in its header comment.
Alternatively you can manually use the Maui Scheduler tools to control the simulation (`showstats`, `schedctl`, `setres`, etc.).  
The results can be found in the `stats` directory (file `simstat.out`).

# Interactive Plots
You can find the plots from the paper as a Jupyter notebook file (`interactive_plots/plots.ipynb`). It loads the plots from Python pickle files (`*.pkl`). Open the file in your own Jupyter notebook environment for interactive display.  
  
You can get a preview (static only) using the Jupyter nbviewer:  
[<img src="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/static/img/nav_logo.svg" width="150" alt="Preview in Jupyter nbviewer">](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/It4innovations/Maui-Simulation/blob/master/interactive_plots/plots.ipynb)  
  
**Note**:  
To avoid incompatibility, please use the same Jupyter notebook environment we have used for creating the pickle files (uses Matplotlib 2.2.x). You can use the Jupyter notebook *scipy-notebook* (tag: 265297f221de) from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/scipy-notebook/). In the subfolder `interactive_plots` of our repository, execute the following command:  
`$ docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "$PWD":/home/jovyan/interactive_plots jupyter/scipy-notebook:265297f221de`  
Once prompted, open the printed URL in the browser. Open the Jupyter notebook file mentioned above and execute the notebook cell for interactive plots.
